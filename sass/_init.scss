// Initialization partial.
//
// To make it easier to use all variables and mixins in any SASS file in this
// theme, each .scss file has a @import "init" declaration. And this _init.scss
// file is in charge of importing all the other partials needed for the theme.
//
// In addition this file should not produce any CSS output whatsoever as it may
// be included in multiple files.
//
// This initialization partial is organized in this way:
// - First we set any shared SASS variables.
// - Next we import our SASS libraries.
// - Last we define our custom mixins for this theme.

// All our theme's variables.
@import "variables";

// Include all the libraries.
@import "libraries";

// Now we add our custom helper mixins.
// // @import "mixins/*";
@import "mixins/animate";
@import "mixins/button-background";
@import "mixins/clearfix";
@import "mixins/em";
@import "mixins/font-size";
@import "mixins/form-elements";
@import "mixins/link-hover-color";
@import "mixins/transform";
@import "mixins/vertical-align";
@import "mixins/visibility";
